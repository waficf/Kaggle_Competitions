# Titanic Machine Leaning First Submission
***
This is my first Kaggle submission, I really learned a lot from practicing
here than from reading several books. You can see that I have taken lots of 
chunks of code from Megan Risdal submission and I tried to run every algorithm
I learned so far for the sake of practice

## 1. Importing the needed libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
```

## 2. Importing Data
```{r}
credit_data <- read.csv('/Users/wafic/Downloads/data/creditcard.csv')
```

```{r}
str(credit_data)
```
