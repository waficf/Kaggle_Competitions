    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature.

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Looking at the results I believe the Random Forest Classifier to be the most useful in predicting who makes more than 50K because among the 3 models, RFC has the highest accuracy and F-score on training data, it performed better than the simple K-NN or the complex SVM, then when looking at the testing data, we can see that the three models are close on accuracy and in F-score especially when including all of the testing data the random forest classifier and SVM had identical F-Score but I prefered the RFC model because it was much (hugely) faster than the SVM in crunshing the numbers thus when the data become huge this model will perform very well and faster. Also, with this type of problem, I believe having a higher accuracy seems very important since we are interested in maximizing the number of classified people as making above 50K, in other words, its better to identify a person as making 50K when he isn't making 50K rather than loosing a person who really makes 50K."

    "Random forest classifier is a supervised learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression problems. Each forest is made of several trees and random forest creates each decision tree based on randomly selecting data samples from your dataset. This sort of algorithm is what you can find in applications as recommendation engines (For example Spotify) and image classification (Similar to that on iPhone photos or Facebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work?\n",
    "1. The algorithm selects a sample of your data (You can reuse the data points in every new sample thus you never run out of new samples)\n",
    "2. It creates one decision trees on each sample \n",
    "3. Gets the predication from each decision tree\n",
    "4. Repeats the process several time (as much as the user prefers)\n",
    "5. After having several decision trees each with its prediction, the model selects will vote for the prediction that occurred the most among all the decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a simple example.\n",
    "Imagine you are expecting to have your first baby and planning to buy your first family SUV but with all choices out there it is confusing. Let’s say you have a budget of say 20,000 USD and your choices are 5 different models from 5 different car manufactures but since you are not an expert on cars (and assume your wife doesn't make the decision) you go around and ask your family members, colleagues at work and friends to choose which of the 5 models, then you add up the number of votes for each model and the model with the highest vote is your decision to take when you go to the dealership.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the example above, the decision trees are the people recommendations for car models, and then the voting on the highest is what is all random forest is about.\n",
    "It has lots of advantages. Random Forests is highly accurate because of the number of decision trees, it has a very low tendency to overfit because it takes the average of all the predictions and it has an amazing feature importance tool that gets you to know which feature is the most important in your data.\n"

    "**Answer:** I believe the occupation, capital-gain, education_level, workclass, age ordered from highest to lowest to be the top 5 feature in importance in our model prediction. I chose occupation because I believe its the most important factor in how much you get paid disregarding your education level, for example a CEO or a basketball player whether a he hold a Masters Degree or even just a high school is guaranteed to get high income. The my choice of capaital_gain makes sense because people who tend to invest make more money than those who labor from 9 to 5. Then there is the education level as the median salary of those educated is higher than those with no high school degree. Also, work-lass is something very important for me because usually government jobs tend to get paid the least even if all variables are the same. Last is the age, now after reviewing the project and thinking of each variable separately, I think age should have been ranked first because it precedes all the other variable and no surprise why it came first in the model feature importance. Thank you for asking me to review this part as I now can see how important it as rather than taking it lightly."

Although, I am not very close I believe these features to be more relevant at least for the data available on hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Now after the review and after going through every variable, It really makes sense that Age is the most valuable among all the other features because it dictates lots of other variables I included earlier like education level, occupation and maybe work class , for example if you’re a CEO it is very rarely you are 20 (unless you are Mark Zuckerberg which should have been removed or smoothened as an outlier) thus making this variable an excellent splitter in my tree that has a very high predictive power . Then I see there is hours-per-week, which I don't believe shall be more important than capital gain because investors official working hours are less than a factory worker but maybe because they are very little, they weigh less in the data."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

For example if this was a recommendation engine, such a reduction in accuracy is acceptable with the speed required to recommend a movie or a soundtrack and the worst the user will get a movie he or she will never watch but I think this is a trade-off everyone can live with."
